Climb the right mountain (prioritize what you really want to do)
Prioritize your health over everything else

Work on your willpower
Become a producer instead of a consumer
Be nice to people on the comeup, you never know what they will be in the future
Watch what most people are doing, and then do the opposite
make as much mistakes as possible
never talk behind people's backs
make reversible decisions quickly, take time with irreversible ones
embrace change
assume you can learn something from anyone you meet
live in the moment
